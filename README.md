# Welcome to My Spaceship
This project simulates a simple navigation system for a spaceship based on predefined commands. The system interprets each command and moves the spaceship accordingly.

## Task
The task of this system is to process an array of movement commands and output the final position and direction of the spaceship.


## Description
I was able to create some switch cases that would handle those commands that would control the movement of the spaceship.

## Installation
For this particular task , i believe no installation is required. You can just run this script in any JavaScript environment.
## Usage
To use this navigation system, you need to pass some strings of commands to the `my_spaceship` function. Each command should be a string consisting of:
- 'R' to turn right
- 'L' to turn left
- 'A' to advance forward
